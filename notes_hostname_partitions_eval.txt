- what is LVM?

	- Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a system for managing disk storage space on Linux systems.
		It allows you to create logical volumes, which are virtual partitions that can span across multiple physical disks or partitions.
		This can be useful in a number of situations, such as when you want to create a large logical volume from multiple smaller disks,
		or when you want to easily resize a volume without having to repartition the disk.

	- Some of the main benefits of using LVM include:

		- The ability to easily resize logical volumes without having to repartition the disk.
	
		- The ability to create logical volumes that span across multiple physical disks or partitions,
			allowing you to use all of your available disk space more efficiently.

		- The ability to easily add or remove physical disks from a volume group without having to reconfigure your disk partitions.
	
		- The ability to create snapshot copies of logical volumes, which can be used for backup or testing purposes.

		- LVM is a powerful tool that can be used to manage your disk space in a more flexible and dynamic way.
			It is widely used on Linux systems and is an important part of many system administrator's toolkit.
