- How does a virtual machine work?

    1. The host computer runs the virtual machine software, which creates one or more VMs.
    2. Each VM is configured with a number of resources, such as memory, processors, and virtual disks.
    3. The virtual machine software installs an operating system and any necessary software in each VM.
    4. Users can access the VMs and run programs on them as if they were using a dedicated physical computer.

- Why Debian rather than Rocky?

	- The choice of Debian over Rocky was made based on the fact that Debian is generally considered
		to be a more user-friendly and accessible operating system, particularly for beginners.

- Basic differences between Rocky and Debian?

	- Rocky Linux is a new Linux distribution that is based on CentOS and designed to be a direct alternative to CentOS.
		It was created in response to concerns about the future of CentOS, which is no longer developed by Red Hat.

	- Debian, on the other hand, is an independent distribution that is not based on any other distribution.

	- Overall, the main difference between Rocky Linux and Debian is that Rocky Linux is designed to be an alternative to CentOS,
		while Debian is a standalone distribution with its own development philosophy and community.

- The purpose of virtual machines?

	- Virtual machines are computer programs that allow a computer to run multiple operating systems concurrently.
		They create a simulated environment on a single physical machine, in which each virtual machine acts as a separate computer
		with its own operating system, processor, memory, and storage.
	
	- Usage:
	
    	1. Testing and development: Virtual machines allow developers to test their software on different operating systems and configurations
			without having to purchase multiple physical machines.
    	2. Isolation and security: Virtual machines can be used to isolate certain tasks or applications from the host operating system,
			which can be useful for security reasons. For example, if you need to run a potentially malicious application, you can do so in a virtual machine,
			which will contain any damage the application might cause.
    	3. Resource allocation: Virtual machines allow you to allocate resources (such as CPU, memory, and storage) to each virtual machine as needed,
			which can be helpful if you have limited physical resources.
    	4. Compatibility: If you need to run an outdated application that is not compatible with your current operating system,
			you can use a virtual machine to run the application in an older operating system.

- The difference between apt and aptitude?

	- apt is a package management program for Debian and its derivatives, such as Ubuntu. It allows for installing, updating
		and managing software packages on a system that uses the Debian package management system (dpkg). apt stands for "Advanced Packaging Tool".

	- aptitude is also a package management program for Debian and its derivatives, but it uses a different text-mode interface from apt.
		aptitude stands for "Advanced Packaging Tool Interface".

	- It is worth noting that aptitude is considered more advanced than apt, as it is able to automatically resolve dependencies and conflicts when installing or removing packages.
		However, apt is often faster and easier to use than aptitude, as it has a simpler interface and more concise syntax.

- What is AppArmor?

	- AppArmor (Application Armor) is a security system that allows for limiting the privileges and actions of a program or process on a Linux system.
		It is a kind of "firewall" that protects the system by limiting the actions of a program to those that are explicitly allowed by the security policy defined for that program.
