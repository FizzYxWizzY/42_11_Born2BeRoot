- What is cron?

	- Cron is a daemon (a background process) that runs commands or scripts at predefined intervals of time, called "cron times".
		It is primarily used on Unix and Linux systems to schedule tasks to be run automatically.

	- Cron uses a configuration file called "crontab" that defines the tasks to be run and their frequency of execution.
		Each line in the crontab corresponds to a task to be run, and contains five fields that define when the task should be run.

	- Each field in the crontab can be defined in different ways:

		- An integer represents an absolute value (for example, to run a task every day at midnight, you would set the first field to 0).

		- An asterisk (*) means that the task should be run at all possible values for that field (for example, to run a task every hour, you would set the second field to *).

		- A list of values separated by commas (e.g. 1,2,3) means that the task should only be run when the field matches one of these values
			(for example, to run a task every day of the week except Saturday and Sunday, you would set the fifth field to 1-5).

		- A range of values separated by a dash (e.g. 2-5) means that the task should be run when the field matches a value within that range
			(for example, to run a task every day of the week from Tuesday to Friday, you would set the fifth field to 2-5).

	- You can use the crontab -e command to edit your crontab and add or modify tasks to be run. You can also use the crontab -l command to view the contents of your crontab.
