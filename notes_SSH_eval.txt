- What is SSH?

	- Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that allows you to remotely connect to a computer and send it commands remotely.
		It is commonly used to access remote servers or computers in a secure and encrypted manner, using an encrypted connection.

	- SSH is widely used to administer remote servers and computers, as well as to transfer files between computers.
		It is also commonly used to establish a remote connection to a computer in order to run commands and use applications as if you were in front of the computer in question.

	- To use SSH, you need an SSH client on your local computer and an SSH server on the remote computer you want to connect to.
		There are many available SSH clients and servers for different platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

- List open SSH ports:

	- sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
